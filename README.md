# FlyTheme

This is the (designated) theme for my page [Flypenguin.de](https://flypenguin.de).

It might not be active yet on the page, because it's a work in progress.

Thanks (at least) to:

- [Bulma](https://bulma.io), the CSS framework used underneath
- [Mert Bakir](https://mertbakir.gitlab.io/about/), for the tag word cloud
- [the Cactus Hugo theme](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus), which served me well for a long time

## TODO

- [x] something is working
- [x] navbar auto-fills with sections
- [x] tag word cloud
- [ ] add my comment engine
- [ ] headings for "tag" list pages
- [ ] footer
- [ ] social icons
- [ ] change fonts
- [ ] change colors
- [ ] add "regular" pages to ... somewhere
